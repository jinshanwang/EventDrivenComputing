# EventDrivenComputing
In the first project, I was asked to implement a DFA(deterministic finite automas 有限状态机) by simulating a game called
"Reaction Controller" based on java programming language. the GUI has been also included and the controller program was 
designed by mealy-moore machine(米粒摩尔机).
