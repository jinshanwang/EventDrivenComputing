# EventDrivenComputing
In the first project, I was asked to implement a DFA(deterministic finite automas 有限状态机) by simulating a game called
"Reaction Controller" based on java programming language. the GUI has been also included and the controller program was 
designed by mealy-moore machine(米粒摩尔机).

In the second project and third project, I was asked to implemented a Map Editor based on the Obsever dedign pattern using MVC model. the transactions between each one of the status have been addressed and accomplished and the graphic user interface 
has been successfully connected with the backend system. all the icon such as the place and road have been added listeners to 
update the status in case of the modification.
